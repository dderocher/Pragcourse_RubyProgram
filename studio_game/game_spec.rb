  If a low number (1 or 2) is rolled, we'll blam the player because low rollers aren't very lucky.
  If a medium number (3 or 4) is rolled, we'll skip the playerâ€”we won't change their health value. Instead, we'll print out something like "Curly was skipped."
 If a high number (5 or 6) is rolled, we'll w00t the player (high fives for the high rollers!)
